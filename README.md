A reddit bot that will (eventually) scan /r/AnimeFigures, looking for [SALE] links and notify me when one pops up

Unlikely to be of much use to anyone else

Ideas for future possible enhancement:

* Better configuration (i.e. config file instead of hard-coded)
  (This is like totally necessary if oath/login is ever needed,
   like for below features...)
* Scan multiple subreddits
* Allow other users to "subscribe" to subreddit scans
